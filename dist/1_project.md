This project is a part of a long term project which consists of a four wheeled autonomous robot and a ma-
nipulator. The ultimate goal of the project is to develop a system capable of replacing the human presence
at locations which are hazardous to their well being. 

Taking an example of nuclear plants, the radiation
from the area is detrimental to the people working in those plants. The exposure to the dangerous elements
lead to a number of threatening problems which can have life long effects on the human body. As has been
witnessed by a number of fatal accidents in such areas, the requirement of a system which can completely
take the place of a human is of utmost necessity
